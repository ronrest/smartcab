# Train a Smartcab How to Drive

This is my submission for the Reinforcement Learning component of 
Udacity's Machine Learnning Nanodegree. 

## Software Requirements
This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)



### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project 
directory `smartcab/` (that contains this README) and run one of the 
following commands:

```python smartcab/agent.py```  
```python -m smartcab.agent```

This will run the `agent.py` file and train the agent.
